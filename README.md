Just a website I am creating to track my Overwatch stats.
It started off as a school project but my teacher asked us to learn some html and make a practice website. Since I knew HTML, CSS, JS, and Python already I decided to go all out. When he asked us to move on from the site to create the one that will actually be graded, I couldn't. But so far from this project I have learned a lot including how to host and intereact with APIs and had a nice refresher in JS, CSS, and HTML.
